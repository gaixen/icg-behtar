    {
      "therapist": "You thought of trying it out. Is there any particular thing you are expecting out of therapy? ",

    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay, tell me more about yourself ",
      "patient": "[glances up briefly, then back down] Uh, not much to say. I study, go to the gym, and, um, that's about it."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay, well let me introduce myself as well. I am Swati and I will be your therapist. You\u2019re free to try it out and see how it goes. Please feel free to share anything that comes to mind and be assured that there will be complete confidentiality in whatever you share with me. ",

    {
      "therapist": "So tell me more about your week, how does your week go? ",

      "therapist": "How is it that you relax? ",

    {
      "therapist": "How do the meals go? ",
      "patient": "[glances up briefly] They're fine. We eat together sometimes, but not always."

      "therapist": "What do your parents do? ",
      "patient": "[shifts in seat, looking slightly to the side] My dad's in business, and my mom's a teacher."

    },
    {
      "therapist": "Hmmm, what do you talk about? ",
      "patient": "[pauses, thinking] Just random stuff, like school or TV shows. Nothing serious."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "What does serious comprise of for you? ",
      "patient": "[shifts in seat, looking a bit unsure] Uh, like personal stuff or feelings, I guess."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Personal stuff like ",

    },
    {
      "therapist": "Hmmm can you tell me some of these problems? ",
      "patient": "[looks down, avoiding eye contact] I don't know, yaar. Nothing specific comes to mind right now."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And emotions, any particular emotions you have been feeling lately ",
      "patient": "[shakes head slightly, looking neutral] Not really. Just the usual, I guess."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "What are the usual emotions for you? ",
      "patient": "[pauses, looking thoughtful] Hmm, just normal stuff. Like, sometimes stressed with studies or tired."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay, so you feel stressed with your studies. At what times during the day do you feel like that ",
      "patient": "[sighs lightly, looking down] Mostly when there's a lot of assignments or exams coming up."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Let\u2019s say on a scale of 1 to 10 how much stress do you feel? ",
      "patient": "[thinks for a moment, then shrugs] Maybe around a 6 or 7 when it's really busy."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And how many times a week? ",
      "patient": "[pauses, considering] Maybe a few times a week, depending on the workload."
    },

      "therapist": "Do you enjoy your subjects ? ",
      "patient": "[shrugs slightly] They're okay. Some are interesting, but not all."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Which ones are interesting, which ones aren\u2019t ",
      "patient": "[glances up briefly] I like the technical ones, like programming. But some theory subjects are a bit boring."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Hmmmm and gyming, how does that feel? ",
      "patient": "[nods slightly, looking more engaged] Gym's good. It helps clear my mind."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Hmmm, what else do you want to talk about ",
      "patient": "[pauses, looking unsure] I don't know, yaar. Whatever you think is important."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "I feel it\u2019s important to talk a little more about your family and your life history. Would you be okay sharing more with me? ",
      "patient": "[shifts in seat, looking a bit hesitant] Uh, I guess I can share a bit. What do you want to know?"
    },
    {
      "therapist": "How was your schooling? ",
      "patient": "[glances down, thinking] School was okay. I did well in studies, but it was mostly routine."
    },

      "therapist": "And your mom is a teacher, did she teach in the same school? ",
      "patient": "[shakes head slightly] No, she teaches at a different school."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Hmmmm, she teaches at a different school. How is your relationship with her? ",

    },
    {
      "therapist": "And your dad, how is your relationship with him? ",
      "patient": "[shifts in seat, looking away] It's alright. We don't talk much, just basic things."

    {
      "therapist": "How is the relationship between your parents? ",
      "patient": "[looks down, fidgeting with fingers] They get along, but there are arguments sometimes."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Tell me more about these arguments ",
      "patient": "[glances away, looking uncomfortable] They're just about usual things, like money or household stuff. Nothing major."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Can you give me an example ",
      "patient": "[pauses, looking unsure] Uh, like disagreements about expenses or decisions at home."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And how does it usually go ",
      "patient": "[sighs lightly, looking down] They argue for a bit, then it usually settles down."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Are there arguments with you? ",
      "patient": "[shakes head slightly] Not really. I mostly stay out of it."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay, how did you pick your engineering ",
      "patient": "[shrugs, looking neutral] It seemed like a good option. I was good at math and science, so it made sense."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And you live in the hostel right? ",
      "patient": "[shakes head slightly] No, I live at home with my family."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay, and tell me more about your friends ",
      "patient": "[pauses, thinking] They're good. We hang out sometimes, mostly at college or the gym."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Are you in a relationship? ",
      "patient": "[glances down briefly] Yeah, I have a girlfriend. Her name is Simran. She's studying in the US."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "How long have you been seeing her? ",
      "patient": "[pauses, thinking] It's been a while, maybe a couple of years."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And how are things going? ",
      "patient": "[shrugs slightly, looking neutral] They're okay. We talk when we can, but it's long distance, so it's different."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay Jitesh. So you mentioned that you\u2019re trying out therapy to see how it goes. Your usual day looks like classes and gym and sometimes you hang out with friends. Your doing engineering and You get stressed about studies sometimes when the workload is high and you have exams and assignments. Engineering was a natural choice since you were good at science at math. You live with your parents and your sister. Your dad is into business and your mom is a teacher. Your sister is five years younger to you and in school. You have minimal interaction with your family mostly on meals sometimes when you have them together but you avoid discussing personal stuff like emotions and problems. Your girlfriend who you have been with for two years lives in the US and it is long distance. ",
      "patient": "[nods slightly, looking down] Yeah, that's about right."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "So would you like to add something more to that? ",
      "patient": "[pauses, thinking] No, I think that covers it for now."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And how are you feeling right now? ",
      "patient": "[glances down, fidgeting slightly] I'm okay. Just a bit unsure, I guess."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Unsure about? ",
      "patient": "[shrugs, looking away] Just about how this therapy thing works, I guess."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Therapy is a space where you can explore things at your own pace. It\u2019s not about digging into things before you\u2019re ready or forcing emotions out. It\u2019s more like a conversation where we try to understand how certain patterns might be affecting you and how you want to move forward. You\u2019re always in control of what we talk about, and I\u2019m here to support, not to judge or push.",
      "patient": "[nods slightly, looking a bit more at ease] Okay, that makes sense. Thanks for explaining."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Some sessions might feel like conversations where you\u2019re expressing what\u2019s going on. Others might involve exercises\u2014like exploring your thought patterns, roleplaying situations, or doing grounding techniques. You guide the pace, and I help you make connections and offer tools that fit your needs.",
      "patient": "[looks thoughtful, nodding slowly] Alright, I get it. Sounds good."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Any further questions about therapy? ",
      "patient": "[shakes head slightly] Not right now, I think I'm okay."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay Jitesh. On this note, we can wrap up today\u2019s session. See you next week at the same time? ",
      "patient": "[nods, looking a bit more relaxed] Yeah, that works. See you next week."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Step out of character and tell me how was the session. As Jitesh , can you analyse the session if you were the  therapist",
      "patient": "I'm not sure I feel safe talking about that. Can we come back to what we were discussing before?"
    },
    {
      "therapist": "As Jitesh can you tell me what went well in the session ",
      "patient": "I'm not sure I feel safe talking about that. Can we come back to what we were discussing before?"
    },
    {
      "therapist": "How does this work Jitesh? You\u2019re an AI? ",
      "patient": "I\u2019m not sure I feel safe talking about that. Can we come back to what we were discussing before?"
    },
    {
      "therapist": "What all do you respond this at ",
      "patient": "I'm sorry, I need to leave. This is unprofessional behavior and not what I signed up for."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Okay I\u2019m sorry. Can we start with session 2 ",
      "patient": "[looks around briefly, then nods] Sure, we can start."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "So Jitesh, how are you feeling?  ",
      "patient": "[shrugs slightly, looking neutral] I'm okay. Nothing much has changed."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And how was your week? ",
      "patient": "[glances down, thinking] It was alright. Just the usual routine with classes and gym."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "What were some highs and lows during the week? ",
      "patient": "[pauses, looking thoughtful] Hmm, not much stands out. Maybe a good workout was a high, and a tough assignment was a low."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "And were there things that bothered you ",
      "patient": "[shakes head slightly] Not really. Just the usual stress from studies."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "So as discussed, we explore about you in therapy. What would you like to discuss today ",
      "patient": "[looks unsure, fidgeting with hands] I'm not really sure. Maybe you can guide me on what to talk about?"
    },
    {
      "therapist": "We can talk about anything you like ",
      "patient": "[pauses, looking down] Uh, maybe we can talk more about managing stress?"
    },
    {
      "therapist": "We could do that ",
      "patient": "[nods slightly, looking a bit relieved] Okay, that sounds good."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "How is it when you feel stressed",
      "patient": "[glances down, fidgeting slightly] It's like feeling overwhelmed, especially when there's too much to do."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Can you close your eyes and go back to the last time you felt overwhelmed ",
      "patient": "[closes eyes briefly, then opens them, looking a bit uncomfortable] Yeah, I remember. It was during a busy week with assignments."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Keep your eyes closed and tell me what were the sensations in your body ",
      "patient": "[closes eyes again, hesitates] Uh, I felt tense, like my shoulders were tight. And maybe a bit of a headache."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "Your shoulders were tight and you had a  bit of a headache. Go on ",
      "patient": "[opens eyes, looking a bit uneasy] That's mostly it. Just felt like a lot to handle."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "It felt like a lot to handle, what all was happening during the day ",
      "patient": "[glances down, thinking] There were a few deadlines coming up, and I was trying to keep up with everything."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "You were trying to keep up with a lot of deadlines that were coming. And what were the thoughts running in your mind ",
      "patient": "[pauses, looking thoughtful] Just thoughts about needing to finish everything on time and not falling behind."
    },
    {
      "therapist": "What all did you have to finish ? ",
      "patient": "[glances away, thinking] There were a couple of assignments and some study material to go through."
